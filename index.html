          Hi Iâ€™m Asaf Davidov. I am a full stack engineer with a passion for tackling complicated financial problems as well as fixing the health care industry. I believe that technology and engaging software can be at the forefront of creating change in these two sectors.  My intrigue for the financial sector always has been a part of me mainly because of the analytical skills that are required. On the other hand, having a healthcare system that is lacking in innovation on a consumer level is inexcusable which I hope to change soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2017 I graduated with a B.A in Computer Science and Economics and decided to enter the financial sector while putting my software engineering skills to rest for a little. After about a year a realized that the types of problem solving that is involved in programming is unique and I decided to jump back in with the help of a bootcamp to up my applicable technical abilities. I am currently strongest in Ruby on Rails, Javascript(ES6) and React.js, however I have had some experience with Node.js, Python, Java and C#.

          When I am not hammering away at my keyboard, I am skiing, playing tennis or watching the newest Netflix standup special.
